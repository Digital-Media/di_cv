        "You can use binary-region properties such as area, perimeter, circularity, centralized moments, and Hu moments to describe the leaves.\n",
        "The `binary_leaves` dataset contains multiple images of 5 different leave types: \n",
        "- Japanese maple,\n",
        "- Chinese cinnamon*,\n",
        "- ginkgo, maidenhair tree,\n",
        "- Chinese tulip tree*, and\n",
        "- tangerine.\n",
        "\n",
        "The binary images are all of the same size, the leaves, however, are rotated and scaled slightly differently. \n",
        "Furthermore, there is natural variation in the leaf shapes, which makes the task more challenging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Try to come up with a good description/threshold for each leaf type and evaluate how good that description is by answering the following questions: \n",
        "- How well can you distinguish between the different leaf types? \n",
        "- Which leaves are easy to distinguish? Which are hard, and why is that?\n",
        "- How many different leaf types can you distinguish?\n",
        "- What are the numbers (e.g., how many percent are correctly classified)?\n",
        "\n",
        "You don't need to use 5 different leave types. \n",
        "Start with less types and add more if you feel confident.\n",

        "**Hint(s):** \n",
        "- You can use all the code that we used for binary images as basis.\n",
        "- For simplicity start with only 2 or 3 leave types and then optionally extend 5 (leave out the leaves with *). \n",
        "- When combining multiple descriptions be careful with ranges and scaling!\n",
        "- When you want to use Hu moments, remember that the later moments (hu_3, hu_4, ....) are very sensitive to noise (maybe don't use them).\n",
